              <head>Chapter 10: Floated Illustrations</head>
              
<p>Miss Clara sat erect. The Primer Class held its breath. It always held
its breath when Miss Clara sat erect. Emmy Lou held tightly to her desk
besides. She wondered what it was all about.</p>

<p>Then Miss Clara spoke. Her accents cut the silence.</p>

<p><quote>Billy Traver!</quote></p>

<p>Billy Traver stood forth. It was the little boy.</p>

<p><quote>Since you seem pleased to occupy yourself with the little girls, Billy,
<i>go to the pegs</i>!</quote></p>

<p>Emmy Lou trembled. <quote>Go to the pegs!</quote> What unknown, inquisitorial terrors
lay behind those dread, laconic words, Emmy Lou knew not.</p>

<p>She could only sit and watch the little boy turn and stump back down the
aisle and around the room to where along the wall hung rows of feminine
apparel.</p>

<p>Here he stopped and scanned the line. Then he paused before a hat. It
was a round little hat with silky nap and a curling brim. It had
rosettes to keep the ears warm and ribbon that tied beneath the chin. It
was Emmy Lou’s hat. Aunt Cordelia had cautioned her to care concerning
it.</p>

<p>The little boy took it down. There seemed to be no doubt in his mind as
to what Miss Clara meant. But then he had been in the Primer Class from
the beginning.</p>

<figure rend="left">
  <graphic url="images/img-019.jpg"/>
  <head><quote>Emmy Lou did not laugh. She made room for Billy.</quote></head>
  <figDesc>Emmy Lou making room for Billy.</figDesc>
</figure>

<p>Having taken the hat down he proceeded to put it upon his own shock
head. His face wore its broad and constant smile. One would have said
the little boy was enjoying the affair. As he put the hat on, the
sixty-nine laughed. The seventieth did not. It was her hat, and besides,
she did not understand.</p>

<p>Miss Clara still erect spoke again: <quote>And now, since you are a little
girl, get your book, Billy, and move over with the girls.</quote></p>

<p>Nor did Emmy Lou understand why, when Billy, having gathered his
belongings together, moved across the aisle and sat down with her, the
sixty-nine laughed again. Emmy Lou did not laugh. She made room for
Billy.</p>

<p>Nor did she understand when Billy treated her to a slow and
surreptitious wink, his freckled countenance grinning beneath the
rosetted hat. It never could have occurred to Emmy Lou that Billy had
laid his cunning plans to this very end. Emmy Lou understood nothing of
all this. She only pitied Billy. And presently, when public attention
had become diverted, she proffered him the hospitality of a grimy little
slate rag. When Billy returned the rag there was something in
it&#8212;something wrapped in a beautiful, glazed, shining bronze paper. It
was a candy kiss. One paid five cents for six of them at the drug-store.</p>

<p>On the road home, Emmy Lou ate the candy. The beautiful, shiny paper she
put in her Primer. The slip of paper that she found within she carried
to Aunt Cordelia. It was sticky and it was smeared. But it had reading
on it.</p>

<p><quote>But this is printing,</quote> said Aunt Cordelia;
<quote>can’t you read it?</quote></p>

<p>Emmy Lou shook her head.</p>

<p><quote>Try,</quote> said Aunt Katie.</p>

<p><quote>The easy words,</quote> said Aunt Louise.</p>

<p>But Emmy Lou, remembering c-a-t, Pussy, shook her head.</p>

<figure rend="center">
  <graphic url="images/img-033.jpg"/>
  <head><quote>Guiding a squeaking pencil across a protesting slate.</quote></head>
  <figDesc>Emmy Lou using her slate</figDesc>
</figure>

<p>Aunt Cordelia looked troubled. <quote>She certainly isn’t catching up,</quote> said
Aunt Cordelia. Then she read from the slip of paper:</p>

<lg>
<l>“Oh, woman, woman, thou wert made</l>
<l>The peace of Adam to invade.”</l>
</lg>

<p>The aunties laughed, but Emmy Lou put it away with the glazed paper in
her Primer. It meant quite as much to her as did the reading in that
Primer: Cat, a cat, the cat. The bat, the mat, a rat. It was the jingle
to both that appealed to Emmy Lou.</p>

<p>About this time rumors began to reach Emmy Lou. She heard that it was
February, and that wonderful things were peculiar to the Fourteenth. At
recess the little girls locked arms and talked Valentines. The echoes
reached Emmy Lou.</p>

<p>The valentines must come from a little boy, or it wasn’t the real thing.
And to get no valentine was a dreadful&#8212;dreadful thing. And even the
timidest of the sheep began to cast eyes across at the goats.</p>

<p>Emmy Lou wondered if she would get a valentine. And if not, how was she
to survive the contumely and shame?</p>

<p>You must never, never breathe to a living soul what was on your
valentine. To tell even your best and truest little girl friend was to
prove faithless to the little boy sending the valentine. These things
reached Emmy Lou.</p>

<p>Not for the world would she tell. Emmy Lou was sure of that, so grateful
did she feel she would be to anyone sending her a valentine.</p>

<p>And in doubt and wretchedness did she wend her way to school on the
Fourteenth Day of February. The drug-store window was full of
valentines. But Emmy Lou crossed the street. She did not want to see
them. She knew the little girls would ask her if she had gotten a
valentine. And she would have to say, No.</p>

<p>She was early. The big, empty room echoed back her footsteps as she went
to her desk to lay down book and slate before taking off her wraps. Nor
did Emmy Lou dream the eye of the little boy peeped through the crack of
the door from Miss Clara’s dressing-room.</p>

<p>Emmy Lou’s hat and jacket were forgotten. On her desk lay something
square and white. It was an envelope. It was a beautiful envelope, all
over flowers and scrolls.</p>

<p>Emmy Lou knew it. It was a valentine. Her cheeks grew pink.</p>

<p>She took it out. It was blue. And it was gold. And it had reading on it.</p>

<p>Emmy Lou’s heart sank. She could not read the reading. The door opened.
Some little girls came in. Emmy Lou hid her valentine in her book, for
since you must not&#8212;she would never show her valentine&#8212;never.</p>

<p>The little girls wanted to know if she had gotten a valentine, and Emmy
Lou said, Yes, and her cheeks were pink with the joy of being able to
say it.</p>

<p>Through the day, she took peeps between the covers of her Primer, but no
one else might see it.</p>

<p>It rested heavy on Emmy Lou’s heart, however, that there was reading on
it. She studied it surreptitiously. The reading was made up of letters.
It was the first time Emmy Lou had thought about that. She knew some of
the letters. She would ask someone the letters she did not know by
pointing them out on the chart at recess. Emmy Lou was learning. It was
the first time since she came to school.</p>

<p>But what did the letters make? She wondered, after recess, studying the
valentine again.</p>

<p>Then she went home. She followed Aunt Cordelia about. Aunt Cordelia was
busy.</p>

<figure rend="right">
  <graphic url="images/img-025.jpg"/>
  <head><quote>She sought the house-boy.</quote></head>
  <figDesc>Emmy Lou seeking the house-boy</figDesc>
</figure>

<p><quote>What does it read?</quote> asked Emmy Lou.</p>

<p>Aunt Cordelia listened.</p>

<p><quote>B,</quote> said Emmy Lou, <quote>and e?</quote></p>

<p><quote>Be,</quote> said Aunt Cordelia.</p>

<p>If B was Be, it was strange that B and e were Be. But many things were
strange.</p>

<p>Emmy Lou accepted them all on faith.</p>

<p>After dinner she approached Aunt Katie.</p>

<p><quote>What does it read?</quote> asked Emmy Lou, <quote>m and y?</quote></p>

<p><quote>My,</quote> said Aunt Katie.</p>

<p>The rest was harder. She could not remember the letters, and had to copy
them off on her slate. Then she sought Tom, the house-boy. Tom was out
at the gate talking to another house-boy. She waited until the other boy
was gone.</p>

<p><quote>What does it read?</quote> asked Emmy Lou, and she told the letters off the
slate. It took Tom some time, but finally he told her.</p>

<p>Just then a little girl came along. She was a first-section little girl,
and at school she never noticed Emmy Lou.</p>

<p>Now she was alone, so she stopped.</p>

<p><quote>Get any valentines?</quote></p>

<p><quote>Yes,</quote> said Emmy Lou. Then moved to confidence by the little girl’s
friendliness, she added, <quote>It has reading on it.</quote></p>

<p><quote>Pooh,</quote> said the little girl, <quote>they all have that. My mamma’s been
reading the long verses inside to me.</quote></p>

<p><quote>Can you show them&#8212;valentines?</quote> asked Emmy Lou.</p>

<p><quote>Of course, to grown-up people,</quote> said the little girl.</p>

<p>The gas was lit when Emmy Lou came in. Uncle Charlie was there, and the
aunties, sitting around, reading.</p>

<p><quote>I got a valentine,</quote> said Emmy Lou.</p>
